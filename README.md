# CRUD App structure. Techs: Next.Js, React - Typescript, TailwindCSS, MongoDB.
It's a simple web application, mobile first, example for doing some team management.
The point of this app is to have the team dashboard with the usefull content displayed for each teamate (I choose some arbitrary things, like firstname / lastname/ birthday/ phone or if the teamate is available or not).
  
#--Actual version is quite done to what i wanted to do --  
Will soon try to deploy it so you could test it before forking the project.

for the global Back-end it's just using NextJS Api endpoints to send/receive GET POST PUT and DELETE http requests. Using Mongoose/MongoDB as Database.
