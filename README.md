# CRUD App structure. Techs: Next.Js, React - typescript, TailwindCSS, MongoDB.
It's a simple application for doing some team management.
The point of this app is to have the team dashboard with the usefull content displayed for each teamate (I choose some random things, like firstname / lastname/ birthday/ phone or if the teamate is available or not).
To this dashboard I attach a hideable form that could create a teamate and make it appear in the board.

Then at the end of the line, a trash icon for deleting and a pencil for editing will be avaible to the team manager.  
  
# ----Actual version is quite done to what i wanted to do ----  
Will soon try to deploy it so you could test it before forking the project.  
  
Will insert a youtube video showing the style and / behavior of the front end.  
  
for the global Back-end it's just using NextJS Api endpoints to send/receive GET POST PUT and DELETE http requests. Using Mongoose/MongoDB as Database.
